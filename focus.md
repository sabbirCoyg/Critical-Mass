# Focus

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.


Firstly, if I am part of the internship program then I will be part of the company. Therefore my main focus would be to learn and sharpen my skill set for myself but in a certain way where I can be beneficial to the company and provide them the best service possible as well. Moreover, by doing so not only I can gain professional experience and learn how a large company like Critical Mass functions but if opportunity comes I will be prepared to be part of a large company like this in the future. During my time as an intern I want to communicate with my colleagues share ideas and learn from them. Also I would like to gain knowledge from experienced developers who are working at the company and listen to their point of view in achieving success in my respective field. I would love to gain experience of working with a team in a professional environment and share my ideas and knowledge on the projects we will be working on. All in all, I want to learn both the technical and the professional part of being a developer for my own personal and professional growth but also help the company archive goals that they expect of me and provide them the best service possible during my time.
