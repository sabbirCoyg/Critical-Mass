1. Chariot App - worked with Saint Mary's University to develop software for the Northwood Nursing and Retirement Home.
It is a personalized software catered specifically to help the elder generation. I worked with a group of six students and developed a Hands-Free Mobile and Web-App. The App incorporated a simple to-do list with a real-time Google-Maps API, where user can input information and a location and the App will provide automatic reminder on reaching location by tracking and monitoring user location and destination. 
My role: I was part of all the major parts of developing and coding of the app. From developing the UI making a functional to do list interface and to make complete use of the Google API. 


Languages Used: Java Script, HTML, JSON, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS. Google Maps API JS.
