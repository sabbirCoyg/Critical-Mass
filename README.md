Work / Project Examples
Provide up to three examples of work/projects that you've recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project.
1. Chariot App - worked with Saint Mary's University to develop software for the Northwood Nursing and Retirement Home.
It is a personalized software catered specifically to help the elder generation. I worked with a group of six students and developed a Hands-Free Mobile and Web-App. The App incorporated a simple to-do list with a real-time Google-Maps API, where user can input information and a location and the App will provide automatic reminder on reaching location by tracking and monitoring user location and destination. 
My role: I was part of all the major parts of developing and coding of the app. From developing the UI making a functional to do list interface and to make complete use of the Google API. 
Languages Used: Java Script, HTML, JSON, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS. Google Maps API JS.

Inspiration
Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.
a) Spotify Using Angular 2: The instructor Brad Traversy is very inspiring and I love the way he teaches how to program. I have been studying full stack development for about a month now and has bought his full stack development package on Eduonix. And this model of Spotify made from MEAN stack is something that inspires me to learn Angular JS framework to the level where I can make an application like that myself in the future. Hoping to work hard enough to learn the ins and outs of this framework and the syntaxes used to develop front and back-end of apps in the future. So that I can create faster and better application and upgrade my skill set.

b) Progress of Artificial Intelligence: I have recently being very interested in artificial intelligence and it inspires me every day thinking of all the possibilities it has to change the world. I have a dream to create  a mental health related App using AI in the future that can help people going with mental health issues but are scared to come out. An anonymous way to help people in need. It is still a long way to go for me in my dream and how I want to implement the App but I have some very specific ideas that I want to implement to achieve my success. But in the mean time I continue to read blog posts and articles related to AI to inspire me and fuel my dreams.

Here is an example of a blog that tells us the recent development of AI app for mental health: https://medium.com/@davidventuri/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-mental-health-care-a7cec436a1ce

c) Data Mining- I am recently studying a course in my University regarding Data Mining. And I have come to see that I really enjoy this course and has inspired me to learn more of the subject. Using SQL queries and then analyzing the data in R is very fascination. I have come to know how powerful a language R is in collecting and analyzing data. The k- means Algorithm, the K-centroid to plot and then analyze data is extra ordinary. I never knew such large amount of data can be clustered in such an efficient way. I am hoping to learn more of this and implement my knowledge in the future. 

Here is an example of a blog that explain and shows the K-means algorithm and clustering: https://www.r-statistics.com/2013/08/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/


Focus
If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.


Firstly, if I am part of the internship program then I will be part of the company. Therefore my main focus would be to learn and sharpen my skill set for myself but in a certain way where I can be beneficial to the company and provide them the best service possible as well. Moreover, by doing so not only I can gain professional experience and learn how a large company like Critical Mass functions but if opportunity comes I will be prepared to be part of a large company like this in the future. During my time as an intern I want to communicate with my colleagues share ideas and learn from them. Also I would like to gain knowledge from experienced developers who are working at the company and listen to their point of view in achieving success in my respective field. I would love to gain experience of working with a team in a professional environment and share my ideas and knowledge on the projects we will be working on. All in all, I want to learn both the technical and the professional part of being a developer for my own personal and professional growth but also help the company archive goals that they expect of me and provide them the best service possible during my time.
