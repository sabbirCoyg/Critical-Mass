#Inspiration


Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.


a) Spotify Using Angular 2: The instructor Brad Traversy is very inspiring and I love the way he teaches how to program. I have been studying full stack development for about a month now and has bought his full stack development package on Eduonix. And this model of Spotify made from MEAN stack is something that inspires me to learn Angular JS framework to the level where I can make an application like that myself in the future. Hoping to work hard enough to learn the ins and outs of this framework and the syntaxes used to develop front and back-end of apps in the future. So that I can create faster and better application and upgrade my skill set.

b) Progress of Artificial Intelligence: I have recently being very interested in artificial intelligence and it inspires me every day thinking of all the possibilities it has to change the world. I have a dream to create  a mental health related App using AI in the future that can help people going with mental health issues but are scared to come out. An anonymous way to help people in need. It is still a long way to go for me in my dream and how I want to implement the App but I have some very specific ideas that I want to implement to achieve my success. But in the mean time I continue to read blog posts and articles related to AI to inspire me and fuel my dreams.


Here is an example of a blog that tells us the recent development of AI app for mental health: https://medium.com/@davidventuri/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-mental-health-care-a7cec436a1ce

c) Data Mining- I am recently studying a course in my University regarding Data Mining. And I have come to see that I really enjoy this course and has inspired me to learn more of the subject. Using SQL queries and then analyzing the data in R is very fascination. I have come to know how powerful a language R is in collecting and analyzing data. The k- means Algorithm, the K-centroid to plot and then analyze data is extra ordinary. I never knew such large amount of data can be clustered in such an efficient way. I am hoping to learn more of this and implement my knowledge in the future. 


Here is an example of a blog that explain and shows the K-means algorithm and clustering: https://www.r-statistics.com/2013/08/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/
